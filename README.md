# Music Album

For this project, I have created using React with Vite.
For API, I have used json server

## To start the Project in Local run the following command

npm run dev

This command will automatically start the json server, hence we can see the collections data in the UI

## State Management - Redux

For State Management I have used Redux Toolkit Library.
